Referee Reports
---------------

Students are required to write three referee reports due in Ses #3, Ses #5, and Ses #7. A referee report evaluates the paper on its readiness for publication by commenting on the results, the structure, and the exposition of the paper. For details, please refer to William Thomson's article:

Guidelines on writing referee reports ({{% resource_link "ec847191-6fdd-4946-995a-bd711fd20857" "PDF" %}})

The suggested articles for the three referee reports are listed below.

Research Paper
--------------

A short 2-3 page progress report on the research paper is due one week after Ses #7, and the final paper is due 6 weeks later at the end of the January Independent Activities Period (IAP). The goal of the research paper is to lay the foundation for dissertation work. The paper may be empirical or theoretical in nature. I will meet with students in the middle of January to check the progress of the paper.
